# Tensorflow and Deep Learning - without a PhD

This repository contains my solutions for the elementary course on codelab "[Tensorflow and deep learning - without a PhD](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-tensorflow-mnist)" by Martin GÃ¶rner(Google) for getting started with Tensorflow and Deep Learning concepts.

The course has two main tasks:
1. Implementing a CNN for MNIST digit classification
2. Implementing a RNN/LSTM for generating text

## Results:

Training a CNN on MNIST dataset:
**Accuracy achieved - 99.1 %**
